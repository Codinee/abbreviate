We had a neat pipeline that would deploy feature branches for you automatically but there were a few problems with it, all around the fact that the CNAME that it created for this new deployment used the raw branch name:\n Route53 CNAMES can\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; - which makes this awkward if you\u0026rsquo;re using Gitflow or something similar There is a character limit so once you\u0026rsquo;ve got rid of the \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; then it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to blow this limit when you consider that a common branch name words such as \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo; is 7 characters long.  Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice if we could automatically detect common words and replace them with a sensible abbreviation? And what about removing non-compliant characters?\nAbbreviate hopes to do exactly this!\nThe basic CNAME example $ abbreviate snake -s '-' application-dev-feature/new-strategy app-dev-feat-new-stg  Shorter variable names Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re converting some \u0026ldquo;Enterprise Standard\u0026rdquo; Java to something a little terser:\n$ abbreviate camel visibleSubscribers visSub  Convert between case styles Perhaps you don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to shorten a string, just change it to your new favourite style. As long as the string is shorter than the maximum length, it will only change cases:\n$ /abbreviate pascal -m 99 visibleSubscribers VisibleSubscribers  "},{"uri":"http://dnnrly.github.io/abbreviate/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"http://dnnrly.github.io/abbreviate/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
